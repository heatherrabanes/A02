## Tutorial on using Webstorm with Git and GitHub
1. The first step is to download and install Git and your IDE onto your computer. The latest version of Git can be found on https://git-scm.com/downloads. We use WebStorm as our IDE, which the download is found on https://www.jetbrains.com/student/.

2. If you do not already have an account on GitHub, the next step is to create and set one up. This can be done on https://github.com/join.

3. Next, launch your IDE, WebStorm. Open the settings and connect GitHub with Webstorm. To do this, access the system preferences, which can be done by pressing (Ctrl+Alt+S). Select Version Control>Git and enter the file path to your Git installation. You may also need to go to Version Control>GitHub and link your GitHub account to your Webstorm project.

4. Now that GitHub is set up, create a new project on Webstorm, which can be done by selecting that option in the welcome screen of Webstorm. We can create a new file to add to our project. Make some edits to the file and save them.

6. Now that you have a working project to use for a repository, we can create a remote repository on GitHub. On the menu, go to Git>GitHub>Share Project to GitHub. It will ask you to enter a name for your GitHub repository and remote branch. We can commit changes by clicking the commit button on the side toolbar or going to Git>Commit on the menu. Add a commit message and click 'Commit and push'. If you are successful, you will be able to find your repository on GitHub. 

7. We can also create and edit files on our remote repository on GitHub. One such file is a README markdown file. Once you have created and edited a file, you can commit the changes.

8. To update the changes you made on your remote GitHub repository to your local repository on your computer, go to Git>Pull on the Webstorm menu. Now your local repository matches your remote repository.

9. Now you can continue to push and pull your commits to and from your local and remote repositoties as your work on your projects.
